# Breast-Cancer-Detection
Abstract: This project aims to detect or to be more specific to classify the given data  (Radiology or Numerical Medical Results for a breast tumor) which will be given as  input to the program is benign or malignant tumor. The problem of tumor classification for its malignancy level has been studied deeply and has a dozen of applications here  and there for everyone whoâ€™s trying to improve a model which has a very reasonable  level of predictability. There are enormous number of algorithms to be used in machine  learning for such a classification problem and this would a great challenge to choose  between, not only this we have also to figure out which parameters for every algorithm  we chose (Tuning Process). We will move through two process or steps, the first one  is to use different classical machine learning algorithms and observe the differences between them and try to choose the relatively best one among them, then we will turn  into neural network model and try to figure out the best number of hidden layers and  activation functions to use in this problem. All of this would be in a program with a  quite good GUI and the user will have the capability to input either Radiology or  Numerical Medical Results and get the results immediately.
